# week5-homework-toggle-switch

Homework week 5 CSS toggle switch exercise.

NB the long 3 second colour fade in the centre of the switch when the input is unchecked is intentional. I was going for an afterglow effect, like a piece of hot metal
cooling down which I think looks quite cool.

I will revisit at some stage to work on the gradient fills as I think they can be improved.

Also, I'm not sure about using display: none; on the checkbox. It solved some layout issues I was having but unsure if this will affect functionality if 
implemented on a live web page.

Just one more thing...

I wanted to change the colour of the div with the .border class when the switch is toggled but can't find the right css selector. I thought input:checked + .border
was the way but it doesn't seem to work. Any ideas?
