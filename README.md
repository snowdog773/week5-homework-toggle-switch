# week5-homework-toggle-switch

Homework week 5 CSS toggle switch exercise.

NB the long 3 second colour fade in the centre of the switch when the input is unchecked is intentional. I was going for an afterglow effect, like a piece of hot metal
cooling down which I think looks quite cool.

I will be revisiting at some stage to work on the gradient fills as I think they can be improved.
